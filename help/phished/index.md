If PhishDetect alerted you of a potential phishing page **there is no need to panic**. If you have not entered your credentials anywhere yet, nothing bad has likely happened. And even in that case there are steps you can take to regain control of your accounts and minimize any damage.

## Are you afraid you might have fallen for a phishing attack?

If you are afraid that you might have fallen for a phishing attack, the first thing to keep in mind is to **not feel guilty or embarrassed in seeking help**. These attacks can be very personalized and sophisticated, hard to recognize and protect against.

If you work for or with an organization that might support you, reach out for help. Even if your organization does not have computer specialists on staff, some of your peers might be in contact with some that could help.

If you do not have access to any immediate support, you could consider leveraging some resources that are available to civil society.

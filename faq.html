<h2 class="md:mt-16 sm:mt-8 mb-8">Do you read or have access to my emails?</h2>

<p>No. The operators of a PhishDetect node do not have access to your email account. The PhishDetect browser extension does not send any email anywhere. The PhishDetect browser extension is able to send to the configured node <b>only</b> a link and, in case you have it opened, the HTML content of the suspicious page you want checked, and <b>only</b> when manually requested by you.</p>

<h2 class="md:mt-16 sm:mt-8 mb-8">Can PhishDetect detect every phishing attack?</h2>

<p>No. PhishDetect is a best effort and it aims at supporting the user in determining whether a page is legitimate or suspicious. Sometimes, PhishDetect might mistakenly flag a page as phishing, while other times it might mistakenly report it as clean. In those cases or in cases of doubt, please get in contact with us or with your PhishDetect node operators.</p>
